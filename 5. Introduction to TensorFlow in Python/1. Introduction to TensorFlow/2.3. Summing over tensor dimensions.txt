Summing over tensor dimensions

You've been given a matrix, wealth. This contains the value of bond and stock wealth for five individuals in thousands of dollars.

wealth = [[11, 50], [7, 2], [4, 60], [3, 0], [25, 10]]

The first column corresponds to bonds and the second corresponds to stocks. Each row gives the bond and stock wealth for a single individual. 
Use wealth, reduce_sum(), and .numpy() to determine which statements are correct about wealth.
