Sequence to sequence models

In the video exercise, you learned about four types of sequence to sequence models: 
many-to-one (classification) and many-to-many (text generation, neural machine translation and language models). 
In this exercise, you have to choose the correct type of model given the following problem description:

You are helping your friend who is a specialist in speech recognition. 
Your friend built a model that can recognize different accents of English, but the model is failing to distinguish homophones - 
words with the same pronunciation but have different meaning such as "sea" vs "see" or "write" vs "right".

You propose to use a model that will use the context around the words to identify the semantic meaning of the words. 
By learning the meaning of the words, the new model would avoid outputs like "Did you sea that car?" - it would identify that in this case, the correct word would be "see".

What type of sequence-to-sequence model is appropriate?

Possible Answers

Many-to-many, because it is a classification model.

Many-to-one, because it is a classification model.

Many-to-many, this problem can be solved with a language model.

Many-to-one, because it is a prediction problem.

Answer : Many-to-many, this problem can be solved with a language model.
