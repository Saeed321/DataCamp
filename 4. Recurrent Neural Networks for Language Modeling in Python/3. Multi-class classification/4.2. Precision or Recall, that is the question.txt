Precision or Recall, that is the question

You learned about a few performance metrics and maybe you are asking, when should I use precision and when should I use recall? 
Those two metrics are calculated for each class, and sometimes it is difficult to understand when to focus on one and when to focus on the other.

Precision is a metric that measures how well the model is predicting some class, while recall measures how well a class is being classified. 
If precision is high for one class, you can trust your model when it predicts that class. 
When recall is high for a class, you can rest assured that that class is well understood by the model.

Follow the instruction to see this comparison between precision and recall with an example. The functions precision_score() and recall_score() are loaded.
•	Compute the precision of the sentiment_model using the sentiment_y_true and sentiment_y_pred variables and store it in the prec_sentiment variable.
•	Print the obtained value.

# Compute the precision of the sentiment model
prec_sentiment = precision_score(sentiment_y_true, sentiment_y_pred, average=None)

print(prec_sentiment)
•	Compute the recall of the sentiment_model using the sentiment_y_true and sentiment_y_pred variables and store on the rec_sentiment variable.
•	Print the obtained value.

# Compute the recall of the sentiment model
rec_sentiment = recall_score(sentiment_y_true, sentiment_y_pred, average=None)
print(rec_sentiment)

Question

You are a manager at a bank responsible for social media analysis with the task to reduce the bad image your bank has obtained recently 
because the organization was not identifying its customers' complaints and needs. 
You implemented a sentiment analysis model to classify tweets mentioning the bank's name into good (compliments) or bad (complaints).
Imagine the results from the previous steps are the precision and recall measures of the class complaints (check the second item on the precision and recall arrays), 
which of the following is correct:
(Don't forget that you can use the console to check the values obtained before.)

Possible Answers
	 
The model is able to correctly classify 75% of the complaint tweets.
	 
The model has 20% error when classifying compliments.
	 
You want a higher recall score to identify most of the customers' complaints instead of a higher precision so you can rely on what the model predicted.
	 
You need to check the accuracy score in order to analyze the complaints of the customers.

Answer : You want a higher recall score to identify most of the customers' complaints instead of a higher precision so you can rely on what the model predicted.
