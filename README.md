These are my completed courses from DataCamp (https://www.datacamp.com) and I will follow the 'Career Tracks' of DataCamp website (All the related courses will be in the specific specialization.
Only programming tasks and quizzes are added. Some programming tasks will not be executed because I am just copying my solutions from DataCamp courses here where the dataset and libraries are mostly proided in advance by them.
If anyone want to replicate these programming code, he/she must download the required libraries/datasets, I am not going to give the complete details of those libraries.
