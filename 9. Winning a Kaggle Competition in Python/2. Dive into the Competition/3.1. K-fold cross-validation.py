•	Create a KFold object with 3 folds.
•	Loop over each split using the kf object.
•	For each split select training and testing folds using train_index and test_index.

# Import KFold
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

# Create a KFold object
kf = KFold(n_splits=3, shuffle=True, random_state=123)

# Loop through each split
fold = 0
for train_index, test_index in kf.split(train):
    # Obtain training and testing folds
    cv_train, cv_test = train.iloc[train_index], train.iloc[test_index]
    print('Fold: {}'.format(fold))
    print('CV train shape: {}'.format(cv_train.shape))
    print('Medium interest listings in CV train: {}\n'.format(sum(cv_train.interest_level == 'medium')))
    fold += 1
