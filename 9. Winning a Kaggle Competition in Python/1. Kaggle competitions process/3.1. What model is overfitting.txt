What model is overfitting?

Let's say you've trained 4 different models and calculated a metric for both train and validation data sets. 
For example, the metric is Mean Squared Error (the lower its value the better). 
Train and validation metrics for all the models are presented in the table below.

Please, select the model that overfits to train data.

Model		Train MSE	Validation MSE
Model 1		2.35		2.46
Model 2		2.20		2.15
Model 3		2.10		2.14
Model 4		1.90		2.35
