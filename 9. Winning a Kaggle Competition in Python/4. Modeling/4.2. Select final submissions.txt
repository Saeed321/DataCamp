Select final submissions
The last action in every competition is selecting final submissions. Your goal is to select 2 final submissions based on the local validation and Public Leaderboard scores. Suppose that the competition metric is RMSE (the lower the metric the better). Keep up with a selection strategy we've discussed in the slides:
1.	Local validation: 1.25; Leaderboard: 1.35.
2.	Local validation: 1.32; Leaderboard: 1.39.
3.	Local validation: 1.10; Leaderboard: 1.29.
4.	Local validation: 1.17; Leaderboard: 1.25.
5.	Local validation: 1.21; Leaderboard: 1.32.
