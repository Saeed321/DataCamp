This repository contains data science related courses with Python from DataCamp. I am enrolled in this program because of Data Insight fellowship (https://www.datainsightonline.com/data-scientist-program). I am grateful to Data Insight for giving me this opportunity. All courses are numbered as assigned to me by Data Insight program. The tasks/quizzes are also arranged in the correct order as by DataCamp. Every chapter is numbered and the tasks/quizzes of that chapter/topics are arranged in subsequent order. For example, the course "Introduction to Python" is numbered as "1. Introduction to Python" and so on. Now, this first course has four chapters which are arranged as: 1. Python Basics, 2. Python Lists, 3. Functions and Packages, and 4. NumPy. And the tasks/assignments of chapter one : 1. Python Basics are arranged in such form : 1.1. The Python Interface, 1.2. When to use Python, 1.3. Any comments, and 1.4. Python as a calculator.
NOTE: Only programming tasks and quizzes are added. Some programming tasks will not be executed because I am just copying my solutions from DataCamp courses here where the dataset and libraries are mostly provided in advance by them. If anyone wants to replicate these programming codes, he/she must download the required libraries/datasets, I am not going to give the complete details of those libraries.
