Aggregate functions practice

Good work. Aggregate functions are important to understand, so let's get some more practice!

Use the SUM function to get the total amount grossed by all films.
SELECT SUM(gross) FROM films;

Get the average amount grossed by all films.
SELECT AVG(gross) FROM films;

Get the amount grossed by the worst performing film.
SELECT MIN(gross) FROM films;

Get the amount grossed by the best performing film.
SELECT MAX(gross) FROM films;
