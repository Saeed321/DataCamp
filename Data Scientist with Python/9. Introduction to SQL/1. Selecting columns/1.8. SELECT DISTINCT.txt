SELECT DISTINCT

Often your results will include many duplicate values. If you want to select all the unique values from a column, you can use the DISTINCT keyword.
This might be useful if, for example, you're interested in knowing which languages are represented in the films table:

SELECT DISTINCT language
FROM films;

Remember, you can check out the data in the tables by clicking on the tabs to the right under the editor!
