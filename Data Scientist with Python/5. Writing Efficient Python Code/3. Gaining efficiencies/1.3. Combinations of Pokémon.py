# Combinations of Pokémon
# Ash, a Pokémon trainer, encounters a group of five Pokémon. These Pokémon have been loaded into a list within your session (called pokemon) and printed into the console for your convenience.
# Ash would like to try to catch some of these Pokémon, but his Pokédex can only store two Pokémon at a time. Let's use combinations from the itertools module to see what the possible pairs of Pokémon are that Ash could catch.

# Instructions

# •	Import combinations from itertools.
# •	Create a combinations object called combos_obj that contains all possible pairs of Pokémon from the pokemon list. A pair has 2 Pokémon.
# •	Unpack combos_obj into a list called combos_2.
# •	Ash upgraded his Pokédex so that it can now store four Pokémon. Use combinations to collect all possible combinations of 4 different Pokémon. Save these combinations directly into a list called combos_4using the star character (*).

# Import combinations from itertools
from itertools import combinations

# Create a combination object with pairs of Pokémon
combos_obj = combinations(pokemon, 2)
print(type(combos_obj), '\n')

# Convert combos_obj to a list by unpacking
combos_2 = [*combos_obj]
print(combos_2, '\n')

# Collect all possible combinations of 4 Pokémon directly into a list
combos_4 = [*combinations(pokemon, 4)]
print(combos_4)
