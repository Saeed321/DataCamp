# Combining Pokémon names and types
# Three lists have been loaded into your session from a dataset that contains 720 Pokémon:
# •	The names list contains the names of each Pokémon.
# •	The primary_types list contains the corresponding primary type of each Pokémon.
# •	The secondary_types list contains the corresponding secondary type of each Pokémon (nan if the Pokémon has only one type).
# We want to combine each Pokémon's name and types together so that you easily see a description of each Pokémon. Practice using zip() to accomplish this task.

# Instructions

# 1. Combine the names list and the primary_types list into a new list object (called names_type1).

# Combine names and primary_types
names_type1 = [*zip(names, primary_types)]

print(*names_type1[:5], sep='\n')

# 2. Combine names, primary_types, and secondary_types (in that order) using zip() and unpack the zip object into a new list.

# Combine all three lists together
names_types = [*zip(names, primary_types, secondary_types)]

print(*names_types[:5], sep='\n')

# 3. Use zip() to combine the first five items from the names list and the first three items from the primary_types list.

# Combine five items from names and three items from primary_types
differing_lengths = [*zip(names[:5], primary_types[:3])]

print(*differing_lengths, sep='\n')
