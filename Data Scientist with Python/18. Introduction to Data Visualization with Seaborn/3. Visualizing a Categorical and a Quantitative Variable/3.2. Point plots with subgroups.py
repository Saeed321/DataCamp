# Point plots with subgroups

# Let's continue exploring the dataset of students in secondary school. This time, we'll ask the question: is being in a romantic relationship associated with higher or lower school attendance? And does this association differ by which school the students attend? Let's find out using a point plot.
# We've already imported Seaborn as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

# •	Use sns.catplot() and the student_data DataFrame to create a point plot with relationship status ("romantic") on the x-axis and number of absences ("absences") on the y-axis. Create subgroups based on the school that they attend ("school")
# Create a point plot with subgroups
sns.catplot(x="romantic", y="absences",
data=student_data, hue = "school",
kind="point", join=False)

# Show plot
plt.show()

# •	Turn off the confidence intervals for the plot.
# Turn off the confidence intervals for this plot
sns.catplot(x="romantic", y="absences",
			data=student_data,
            kind="point",
            hue="school", ci = None)

# Show plot
plt.show()

# •	Since there may be outliers of students with many absences, import the median function from numpy and display the median number of absences instead of the average.
# Import median function from numpy
from numpy import median

# Plot the median number of absences instead of the mean
sns.catplot(x="romantic", y="absences",
			data=student_data,
            kind="point",
            hue="school",
            ci=None,
            estimator=median)

# Show plot
plt.show()
