# Which day of the week?

# Hurricane Andrew, which hit Florida on August 24, 1992, was one of the costliest and deadliest hurricanes in US history. Which day of the week did it make landfall?

# Let's walk through all of the steps to figure this out.

# Import date from datetime
from datetime import date

# Create a date object for August 24, 1992.
# Import date from datetime
from datetime import date

# Create a date object
hurricane_andrew = date(1992, 8, 24)

# Now ask Python what day of the week Hurricane Andrew hit (remember that Python counts days of the week starting from Monday as 0, Tuesday as 1, and so on).

# Import date from datetime
from datetime import date

# Create a date object
hurricane_andrew = date(1992, 8, 24)

# Which day of the week is the date?
print(hurricane_andrew.weekday())
