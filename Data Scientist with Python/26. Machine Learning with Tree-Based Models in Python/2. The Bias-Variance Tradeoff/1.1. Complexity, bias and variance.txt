Complexity, bias and variance

In the video, you saw how the complexity of a model labeled f^f^ influences the bias and variance terms of its generalization error.
Which of the following correctly describes the relationship between f^f^'s complexity and f^f^'s bias and variance terms?

Answer the question

Possible Answers
	 
As the complexity of f^ decreases, the bias term decreases while the variance term increases.
	 
As the complexity of f^ decreases, both the bias and the variance terms increase.
	 
As the complexity of f^ increases, the bias term increases while the variance term decreases.
	 
As the complexity of f^ increases, the bias term decreases while the variance term increases.

Answer : As the complexity of f^ increases, the bias term decreases while the variance term increases.
