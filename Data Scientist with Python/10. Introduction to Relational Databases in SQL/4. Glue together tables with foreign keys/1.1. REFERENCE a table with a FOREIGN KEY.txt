REFERENCE a table with a FOREIGN KEY

In your database, you want the professors table to reference the universities table. You can do that by specifying a column in professors table that references a column in the universities table.

As just shown in the video, the syntax for that looks like this:
ALTER TABLE a 
ADD CONSTRAINT a_fkey FOREIGN KEY (b_id) REFERENCES b (id);

Table a should now refer to table b, via b_id, which points to id. a_fkey is, as usual, a constraint name you can choose on your own.
Pay attention to the naming convention employed here: Usually, a foreign key referencing another primary key with name id is named x_id, where xis the name of the referencing table in the singular form.

Rename the university_shortname column to university_id in professors.
-- Rename the university_shortname column
ALTER TABLE professors
RENAME COLUMN university_shortname TO university_id;

•	Add a foreign key on university_id column in professors that references the id column in universities.
•	Name this foreign key professors_fkey.

-- Rename the university_shortname column
ALTER TABLE professors
RENAME COLUMN university_shortname TO university_id;

-- Add a foreign key on professors referencing universities
ALTER TABLE professors 
ADD CONSTRAINT professors_fkey FOREIGN KEY (university_id) REFERENCES universities (id);

Run the DELETE and SELECT queries to double check that the deletion cascade actually works.
-- Identify the correct constraint name
SELECT constraint_name, table_name, constraint_type
FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';

-- Drop the right foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE affiliations
DROP CONSTRAINT affiliations_organization_id_fkey;

-- Add a new foreign key constraint from affiliations to organizations which cascades deletion
ALTER TABLE affiliations
ADD CONSTRAINT affiliations_organization_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations (id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Delete an organization 
DELETE FROM organizations 
WHERE id = 'CUREM';

-- Check that no more affiliations with this organization exist
SELECT * FROM affiliations
WHERE organization_id = 'CUREM';
