Inner join with using

When joining tables with a common field name, e.g.
SELECT *
FROM countries
  INNER JOIN economies
    ON countries.code = economies.code

You can use USING as a shortcut:
SELECT *
FROM countries
  INNER JOIN economies
    USING(code)

You'll now explore how this can be done with the countries and languages tables.
•	Inner join countries on the left and languages on the right with USING(code).
•	Select the fields corresponding to:
o	country name AS country,
o	continent name,
o	language name AS language, and
o	whether or not the language is official.

Remember to alias your tables using the first letter of their names.

-- 4. Select fields
SELECT c.name AS country, c.continent, l.name AS language, l.official
  -- 1. From countries (alias as c)
  FROM countries AS c
  -- 2. Join to languages (as l)
  INNER JOIN languages AS l
    -- 3. Match using code
    USING(code)
