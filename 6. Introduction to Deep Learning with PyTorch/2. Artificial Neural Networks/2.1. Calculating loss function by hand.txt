Calculating loss function by hand

Let's start the exercises by calculating the loss function by hand. Don't do this exercise in PyTorch, it is important to first do it using only pen and paper (and a calculator).
We have the same example as before but now our object is actually a frog, and the predicted scores are -1.2 for class 0 (cat), 0.12 for class 1 (car) and 4.8 for class 2 (frog).

What is the result of the softmax cross-entropy loss function?

Class		Predicted Score

Cat		     -1.2

Car		     0.12

Frog		     4.8

Score for frog is high, so loss is 0.

Answer : 0.0117
