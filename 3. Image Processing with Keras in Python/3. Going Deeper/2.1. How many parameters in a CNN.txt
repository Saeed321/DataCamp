How many parameters in a CNN?

We need to know how many parameters a CNN has, so we can adjust the model architecture, 
to reduce this number or shift parameters from one part of the network to another. 
How many parameters would a network have if its inputs are images with 28-by-28 pixels, 
there is one convolutional layer with 10 units kernels of 3-by-3 pixels, using zero padding (input has the same size as the output), 
and one densely connected layer with 2 units?
