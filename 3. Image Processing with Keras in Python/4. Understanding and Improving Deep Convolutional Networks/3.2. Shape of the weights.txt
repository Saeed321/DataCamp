Shape of the weights

A Keras neural network stores its layers in a list called model.layers. For the convolutional layers, you can get the weights using the .get_weights() method. 
This returns a list, and the first item in this list is an array representing the weights of the convolutional kernels. 
If the shape of this array is (2, 2, 1, 5), what does the first number (2) represent?

Possible Answers
	 
There are 2 channels in black and white images.
	 
The kernel size is 2 by 2.
	 
The model used a convolutional unit with 2 dimensions.
	 
There are 2 convolutional layers in the network.

Answer : The kernel size is 2 by 2.
