#	Select the first 32 characters of the variable movie1 and assign it to the variable first_part.

# Select the first 32 characters of movie1
first_part = movie1[:32]

#	Select the substring going from the 43rd character to the end of movie1. Assign it to the variable last_part.

# Select the first 32 characters of movie1
first_part = movie1[:32]

# Select from 43rd character to the end of movie1
last_part = movie1[42:]

#	Select the substring going from the 33rd to the 42nd character of movie2. Assign it to the variable middle_part.

Hint

#	To select a substring going from the mth to the nth character of a variable, use variable[m-1:n].

# Select the first 32 characters of movie1
first_part = movie1[:32]

# Select from 43rd character to the end of movie1
last_part = movie1[42:]

# Select from 33rd to the 42nd character of movie2
middle_part = movie2[32:42]

#	Print the concatenation of the variables first_part, middle_partand last_part in that order. Print the variable movie2 and compare them.

# Select the first 32 characters of movie1
first_part = movie1[:32]

# Select from 43rd character to the end of movie1
last_part = movie1[42:]

# Select from 33rd to the 42nd character
middle_part = movie2[32:42]

# Print concatenation and movie2 variable
print(first_part + middle_part + last_part)
