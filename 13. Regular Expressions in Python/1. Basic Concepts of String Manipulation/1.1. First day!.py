#	Find out how many characters the variable movie has.

Hint

#	For example, if you want to find out how many characters var has, you can try using len(var).

# Find characters in movie variable
length_string = len(movie)

#	Convert the numeric variable length_string to a string representation.

# Find characters in movie variable
length_string = len(movie)

# Convert to string
to_string = str(length_string)

#	Concatenate the predefined variable statement and the variable to_string adding a space between them. Print out the result.

Hint

#	To print out the concatenation of the string1 and string2, print(string1+string2) can be used. Don't forget to add a space (" ") between both strings.

# Find characters in movie variable
length_string = len(movie)

# Convert to string
to_string = str(length_string)

# Predefined variable
statement = "Number of characters in this review:"

# Concatenate strings and print result
print(statement + " " + to_string)
